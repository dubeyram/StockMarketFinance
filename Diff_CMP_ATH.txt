1. **Imports**: 
   - The code imports the `yfinance` library, which is used for fetching historical market data from Yahoo Finance.

2. **Function `get_stock_info`**: 
   - This function takes an NSE code (stock symbol) as input and returns a dictionary containing various information related to the stock.
   - It attempts to download stock information using `yfinance`.
   - The function extracts the current market price (`CMP`) from the downloaded data.
   - It also calculates the all-time high (`ATH`) price from the historical data.
   - Then, it calculates the percentage difference between the current market price and the all-time high.
   - The function returns a dictionary containing the NSE code, current price, all-time high, and the percentage difference.
   - If any error occurs during the process, such as an invalid NSE code or data being unavailable, it returns a dictionary indicating the error.

3. **Example Usage**: 
   - The code prompts the user to enter an NSE code (stock symbol).
   - It calls the `get_stock_info` function with the entered NSE code to fetch the required stock information.
   - If the function returns an error message, it prints the error.
   - Otherwise, it prints out the fetched information, including the NSE code, current market price, all-time high, and the percentage difference between the current price and the all-time high.

In summary, this code provides a simple tool to fetch information about a stock, including its current market price, all-time high price, and the percentage difference between them. It utilizes the `yfinance` library to download historical market data and performs calculations based on that data.
